# DataScience & SageMath JupyterLab Dockerfile 
### By: Rahim Khoja (rahim@khoja.ca)

A JupyterLab dockerfile that is based on the Stack DataScience Jupyter Image that also includes a SageMath kernel and many additional extensions.

## Docker Stacks Jupyter Images

## Support

Since I am extremely lazy I am not going to offer any support. Well maybe every once-n-a while. It really depends on my mood. 

That being said, time was spent documenting each command in the scripts. This should allow the scripts to be easily understood and modified if needed. 


## Donations
Many Bothans died getting this DataScience and SageMath JupyterLab Dockerfile to you, honor them by sending me some Crypto. ;)
